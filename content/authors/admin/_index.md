I'm now a PhD student in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at the University of Hong Kong. I'm passionate about deep learning theory and high dimension statistics. Before coming to the University of Hong Kong, I completed my master's degree at The University of Science and Technology of China and gained valuable experience and expertise in Stochastic Differential Equations and Deep Learning. Now, as a PhD student, I'm continuing to pursue my research interests and expand my knowledge in the field of statistics and machine learning. On this website, you'll find information about my research and publications. Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to sharing my work with you!
