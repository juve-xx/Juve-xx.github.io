title: An investigation on XOR data



summary: We are excited to introduce our works on optimization theory for XOR data.
abstract: 'In this work, we investigate a class of XOR-type classification tasks with label-flipping noises. We show that, under a certain condition on the sample complexity and signal-to-noise ratio, an over-parameterized ReLU CNN trained by gradient descent can achieve near Bayes-optimal accuracy. Moreover, we also establish a matching lower bound result showing that when the previous condition is not satisfied, the prediction accuracy of the obtained CNN is an absolute constant away from the Bayes-optimal rate. Our result demonstrates that CNNs have a remarkable capacity to efficiently learn XOR problems, even in the presence of highly correlated features.'
